# About

This is a side project. There is a fixed content which must be styled by taste.

# The problem

* The links to other solutions are referred in the text, so they must be visible where they are mentioned.
* The content is a very long text. Special typographic elements must be employed.

# Goals

* Make the reader read all content
* Make the reader feel comfortable during the entire read
* Finally make the reader happy and excited


# Style

* Do not use images. Let this be a pure typographic experience.
* Do not overuse colors. Let this be a pure typographic experience.
* Where necessary employ the flat design technique.


# The solution

* Links to other designs are fixed right. They are all accessible anytime.
* Text is break into _slides_. Each slide is a separate read with smooth transition to the next slide.
* Slides are responsive. They took a single screen on all devices and displays.
